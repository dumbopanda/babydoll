\quad My sincerest thanks go to my project guide, Dr. Saket Verma, Assistant Professor in the School of Energy Science and Engineering. His invaluable guidance and constant, upbeat encouragement were the driving forces behind this project. I especially appreciate his thoughtful and insightful suggestions at every turn.


I would also like to thank Mr. Pappu Kumar, MSR, SESE for helping throughout the setbacks and learning curve of this project.
